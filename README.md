# Problem

Historical data for H1B visas are  available from the US Department of Labor and its [Office of Foreign Labor Certification Performance Data](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/performancedata.cfm#dis). But while there are ready-made reports for [2018](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/pdf/PerformanceData/2018/H-1B_Selected_Statistics_FY2018_Q4.pdf) and [2017](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/pdf/PerformanceData/2017/H-1B_Selected_Statistics_FY2017.pdf), the site doesnâ€™t have them for past years. 

Therefore, we should analyze the past data and particularly do calculations in two metrics: **Top 10 Occupations** and **Top 10 States** for **certified** visa applications.

We also want the code to be working for all years and producing the required results.

# Approach

Raw data is large and we are only interested in subset of the raw data which are the cases where case status is **CERTIFIED**. To do that efficiently without storing the whole data in Python namespace, we will filter only the rows of interest as we are reading the file. In addition, we are not interested in all columns of the data so we will also store the columns of interest for our problem.
